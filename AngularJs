# Angular Features(build-in) 
  - Angular provides built-in features for animation, http service, and materials which in turn have features such as auto-complete, navigation, toolbar, menus, etc.
  - The code is written in Typescript, which compiles to JavaScript and displays the same in the browser.
  
 # Applications of Angular 7
   1. Google Supported Community - Google actively supports Angular and its development. Angular is used in various Google Apps.
   2. POJO based development - Angular heavily used Plain Old JavaScript Object and it helps in learning Angular in an easier way.
   3. Declarative User Interface - Angular uses HTML as view language and extends its functionality. It helps in handling UI vs code differentiation and UI is loosely coupled with code.
   4. Typescript - Typescript is super set of javascript and is easy to debug. It is highly secure and is object oriented.
   5. Modular Structure - Angular development is highly modular, is component based and is highly maintainable.
   6. Multi-platform support - Angular code works well on all platforms without much change in code.

# Folder Structure & File Structure

  We will consider the angular7-app project. Let us open the angular7-app and see how the folder structure looks like.

  The angular7-app/ folder has the following folder structure−
  
    1. e2e/ − end to end test folder. Mainly e2e is used for integration testing and helps ensure the application works fine.

    2. node_modules/ − The npm package installed is node_modules. You can open the folder and see the packages available.

    3. src/ − This folder is where we will work on the project using Angular 7.Inside src/ you will app/ folder created during the project setup and holds all the required files required for the project.
    
 The angular7-app/ folder has the following file structure −

    1. angular.json − It basically holds the project name, version of cli, etc.

    2. .editorconfig − This is the config file for the editor.

    3. .gitignore − A .gitignore file should be committed into the repository, in order to share the ignore rules with any other users that clone the repository.

    4. package.json − The package.json file tells which libraries will be installed into node_modules when you run npm install.
    
    5. tsconfig.json − This basically contains the compiler options required during compilation.

    6. tslint.json − This is the config file with rules to be considered while compiling.

    The src/ folder is the main folder, which internally has a different file structure.
